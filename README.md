## Computer and software instructions for the 3D Morphometrics Workshop
**Computer specs:** Please bring a laptop with these suggested specs:
*	A quad-core CPU from last couple years (i7 or i5 is preferred). 
*	1920x1080 or higher screen resolution.
*	8GB or more RAM (memory)
*	100-200GB available storage space (for software and data). Please note that solid state drives (SSD) both SATA and non-volatile memory express (NVMe) are preferred over spinning hard-drive disks (HDD) due their high sequential read/write performance (usually 10X or more faster than HDDs). 
*	 A discrete (not an integrated one) GPU with minimum of 2GB of RAM with the latest GPU driver installed. (This is not a must, but a recommendation)  
*	A three-buttoned mouse. 

Your laptop should be running windows 10 (windows 7 has issues and is not supported anymore), or Mac OS High Sierra (10.13) or later.  A recent version of a common Linux distribution (like Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7 or later) is also fine.
Please note that segmentation is a memory intensive operation. It is suggested, you have 6-10X more memory than your full dataset size (i.e., if you are working on a 1024x1024x1024 dataset, you will need about 10GB RAM to work on in Slicer). You can always reduce your dataset to match your hardware capacity.

## Required software
Please participate in one of the tech check-ins scheduled for 
1. August 11th, 11-12p (Pacific Daylight Time)
2. August 13th, 10-11 (Pacific Daylight Time)
