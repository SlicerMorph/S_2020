## ImageStacks
This is a SlicerMorph specific utility to import non-DICOM image sequences (TIF/PNG/JPG/BMP) into 3D Slicer. It provides additional features such as only loading a subset of the data, downsampling (by factor of 2), skipping slice(s) along the Z plane, and reverse the stack order. You can also specify the voxel spacing for your dataset at the import time. `ImageStacks` always produces a ScalarVolume (single channel), so that volumes can be immediately visualized or can be processed with `Segment Editor`.
